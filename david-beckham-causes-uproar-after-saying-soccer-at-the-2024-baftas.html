Well, that might be true in football — or soccer — but it’s not true for the filmmakers nominated for outstanding debut. They got it right [the] first time.”</p><p>The comment was followed by a firestorm of criticism on social media given that the BAFTAs are an English event, with one user writing via X , “Don’t you dare say soccer, David. Who even are you?”</p><p>“That might be true in football, or soccer- DAVID BECKHAM YOU ARE ON THE BAFTAS DON’T YOU DARE PANDER TO THE AMERICANS!!!” another added.</p><p>“David Beckham it’s a British awards show, you don’t need to mention soccer,” a third user wrote, while a fourth accused Beckham of “pandering to the Americans.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/David-Beckham-Upsets-England-for-Saying-Soccer-BAFTA-Awards-2.jpg><p>Beckham has not yet responded to the awards show backlash, but he spent his career playing both in the U.S. and overseas before retiring from the sport in 2013.
