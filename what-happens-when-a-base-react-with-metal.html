This confirms that non-metal oxides are acidic in nature. Example-Sodium hydroxide gives sodium carbonate and water when it reacts with carbon dioxide.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-bases-corrosive-to-metals></span>Are bases corrosive to metals?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Common bases, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, can also <b>attack some metals</b> like aluminum, zinc, galvanized metal, and tin to produce hydrogen gas.
