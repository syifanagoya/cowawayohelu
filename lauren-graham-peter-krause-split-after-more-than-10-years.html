However, Graham and Krause’s relationship didn’t become romantic until they started working together on <a href=#>Parenthood</a> in 2010.</p><p>Graham played Sarah Braverman on the drama from 2010 to 2015, while <a href=#>Krause portrayed her brother</a> Adam Braverman.</p><p>“Nobody knew about it for a while <a href=#>because we like to be at home</a>, cooking and not going out,” the Hawaii native told Redbook in October 2010 of their quiet start as a couple. “I’ve also been really protective of it because it’s important that you can buy us as brother and sister on the show.”</p><p>The Talking as Fast as I Can author gave fans a glimpse at the pair’s private romance during a January 2017 interview with <a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>.</p><p>“It’s not a big, loud life,” Graham explained. “We have a lot of neighbors, people come by, we’re with Peter’s son [Roman, whom he shares with ex <strong>Christine King</strong>] a lot and we keep it small.”</p><p>She noted that they got serious shortly after they decided to date. “Once we got together, there was no game play[ing],” the Evan Almighty actress said. “It was like, ‘You like me, and I like you.’ It gave me an understanding of life: This is how things happen, and it’s completely random.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mighty Ducks: Game Changers star</a> shared an update on her and Krause’s dynamic in April 2021 while appearing on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>. Graham explained that after five months apart amid the COVID-19 travel restrictions, things had shifted.</p><p>“Normally it’s a two-hour flight, I’d come home on the weekends, but I couldn’t do that [because of COVID], so we were separated for almost five months, which had never happened before,” she said. “So when I came home the house was a little different. There were more piles, I would say.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Graham noted that she and the Six Feet Under alum spent a lot of quarantine with Krause’s 20-year-old son, and so when she was away for work, the men got into their own groove.</p><p>“I think the reentry was more difficult,” the <a href=#>Someday, Someday, Maybe author</a> confessed. “It was more like they were the married couple, and I was the person who … they were like, ‘We don’t do it that way anymore.’ They were like, ‘No, no, no, this is how things happen.’” She added that overall, their time as a trio was “fantastic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaWnsq95xquYoZmdYr2mwMSrZKSqkarApnnSqaOirF2Ws7Wx0WakqKqVYsGprc1maGllqZqus7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-terminal-is-southwest-at-burbank-airport-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which terminal is southwest at Burbank Airport?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./denise-morgan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Irish Woman Denise Morgan Shot and Killed in New York</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-heirs-to-enormous-american-fortunes.html>15 Heirs To Enormous American Fortunes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./seabiscuit.html>Seabiscuit (Movie) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./badou-jack.html>Badou Jack Height, Age, Wife, Biography, Family, Net worth &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kris-jenner-blackmailed-naked-footage-kuwtk-sneak-peek-2015234.html>Kris Jenner Gets Blackmailed With Naked Footage in KUWTK Sneak Peek</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-rosado-net-worth.html>Gabriel Rosado Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVlog.
