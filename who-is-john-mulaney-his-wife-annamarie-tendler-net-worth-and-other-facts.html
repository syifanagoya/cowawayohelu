In place of reports, he would get together with his best friend named John O’Brien, and the two would perform skits about what they had learned in school. He was also a frequent visitor to the Museum of Broadcast Communications which allowed him to watch archived episodes of the shows he loved.</p><p>The would-be comedian graduated from St. Ignatius Colleg Prep in the year 2000 and then went to the university his parents had attended – Georgetown University – to study English Literature and Religion. At Georgetown, he joined an improv group, which had Nick Kroll and Mike Birbiglia as members, and after they had connected in the group, he would later join Birbiglia to do stand-up tours that helped him get better on his stagecraft.</p><p>Following his graduation, John Mulaney moved to New York and got hired as a Comedy Central office assistant.
