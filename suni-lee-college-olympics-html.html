She flaunted her winnings on Instagram in a snap with her parents. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Lee's Words of Appreciation</h2><p>Before the start of her freshman year, the Olympic athlete spoke at a press conference, which the Auburn Gymnastics later shared on their Instagram page.</p><p>Lee told the attending reporters that everyone on campus had been very welcoming of her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She also appreciated everyone reaching out to her separately just to ensure that she had all she needed before sharing her excitement over the opportunity to compete for her university. She added,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The team has really amazing girls and they all bring something to the table, so I'm really&nbsp;excited to be competing with them. And I'm really excited for how this season is going to go because I feel like we're gonna be really good this year.</p><h2>An Olympian Going to College</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Admittedly, it is rather rare for an Olympian to go back to college after achieving so much success at the Olympic games. However, in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview for AuburnTigers.com</a>, she explained that it was important for her to continue her education.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She stated she had to take advantage of the opportunity she was presented with. Because nobody had done it before, she expressed her desire to be the face of the idea that people can attend college and still make money.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet reported&nbsp;she would be supported by a management team to handle her endorsements and appearances. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her time in the university, she would be looking towards&nbsp;Auburn gymnastics head coach&nbsp;Jeff Graba&nbsp;and assistant coach&nbsp;Ashley Johnston&nbsp;for guidance.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Lee Is Focused on Resting</h2><p>For the time being, though, the athlete had converged all her focus on&nbsp;resting up after an understandably tiring time competing at the Olympics. She said,&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, rest is the main focus because at the Olympics I was a little bit beat up. Coming here, I was hoping to let my body rest, and mentally as well, because that does take a lot out of me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Lee was also looking forward to being able to go out without being called out. But, of course, having made history at the Olympics recently had put a huge spotlight on her. Still, she was hopeful that the excitement would die down in due time.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Being an elite gymnast, she seldom had time to have fun and hang around with her friends. So, that was also something she was hoping to change as she pursued higher education.</p><p>She will be a member of the first class of NCAA student-athletes to capitalize on her name and will be a business student for her undergraduate years.</p><p>The university's publication reported that her business education at Auburn would be multifaceted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She will study marketing principles at school and readily apply her knowledge elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKulo7ZuuMSeZJynnKGyqLGMqKOypaCesLR6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-tobias-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Tobias Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessie-usher-age-life-ethnicity-wiki-biography-religion-dating-height-weight-girlfriend-net-worth-a-train-the-boys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessie Usher, Age, Life, Ethnicity, Wiki, Biography, Religion, Dating, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, N</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-heirs-to-enormous-american-fortunes.html>15 Heirs To Enormous American Fortunes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./seabiscuit.html>Seabiscuit (Movie) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./badou-jack.html>Badou Jack Height, Age, Wife, Biography, Family, Net worth &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kris-jenner-blackmailed-naked-footage-kuwtk-sneak-peek-2015234.html>Kris Jenner Gets Blackmailed With Naked Footage in KUWTK Sneak Peek</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-rosado-net-worth.html>Gabriel Rosado Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVlog.
