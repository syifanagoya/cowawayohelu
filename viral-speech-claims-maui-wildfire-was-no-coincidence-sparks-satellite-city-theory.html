The speech, delivered by a middle-aged woman now affectionately known as “Auntie” on social media, has <a href=#>sparked intense discussions</a> about the fire’s origins and <a href=#>potential hidden motives.</a></p><p>In a now-viral video clip, Auntie expressed her belief that the wildfire was not a mere coincidence. She decried the lack of water resources to combat the fire and the absence of timely warnings for residents to protect their loved ones and properties.</p><p>“Everybody talking about the satellite city before the fire. Lahaina gonna be the first satellite city!” Auntie exclaimed during her fiery speech.</p><p>She went on to assert that the fire was no accident but rather a planned event, alleging that influential figures like Jeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey had vested interests in this calamity. She strongly criticized these individuals and other elites who owned properties on Maui.</p><p>Auntie’s assertion that Lahaina would become a “satellite city” following the fire has fueled widespread interest online. According to Pediaa, a satellite city is a smaller urban area situated in close proximity to a larger metropolitan region. This concept draws parallels to traditional downtown areas, surrounded by inner city neighborhoods.</p><p>The term “satellite city” originates from the notion of artificial satellites orbiting Earth, separate from its surface. In practice, a satellite city is physically separated from the main metropolis by geographic features or territorial boundaries.</p><p>For instance, Pakenham and Sunbury serve as satellite cities near Melbourne. In the case of Lahaina, it would have taken on the role of a satellite city relative to Maui’s metropolis.</p><p>One intriguing aspect of a satellite city is its potential for lower living costs and more affordable land values, offering an alternative to the high-tech environment of a smart city.</p><p>The significance of a satellite city lies in its capacity to address urbanization challenges, providing an extension of the metropolis that helps residents escape crowds, traffic, and other urban complications.</p><p>In her viral speech, Auntie, the middle-aged woman now capturing online attention, shared her impassioned views on the Maui wildfire. She highlighted the breakdown in communication, alleging that phones ceased functioning hours before the fire outbreak in Lahaina.</p><p>“We busted our *ss and this is what we get. Nobody called us. Our phones didn’t work from five in the morning. The fire was not until 10 o’clock when I went to work,” Auntie exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>This timeline of events, she suggested, indicated a suspension of communication prior to the fire’s ignition. She further lamented the absence of water resources and official warnings following the fire’s outbreak.</p><p>“Tell me if that’s a coincidence,” she provocatively questioned.</p><p>Yet, what resonated most with online audiences was Auntie’s assertion regarding the “satellite city” concept and Lahaina’s rumored fate, an idea purportedly circulating before the fire.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lahaina resident going off:</p><p>"This is what we get? Nobody called us! No water, no warning and everybody talking about the satellite city before the fire. Hey Jeff Bezos, you got what you wanted, Oprah you got what you wanted! F–k us over!" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/S4zzimGN6v</a></p><p>— Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 28, 2023</a></p><p>“Well hey, Jeff Bezos, you got what you wanted. Oprah, you got what you wanted. And the guy who owns the night, you got what you wanted. F*ck us all over. That’s what happened,” Auntie passionately concluded, singling out those she perceived as responsible for the Maui wildfire.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kw6q%2BwKVkrKiVmrCpecKlmKKlo2K6osHIZq6ipJSbtrOxjLCYrGWepHqku8inmqKclaOwpnnSqZiro6NiwKLAxKWjoqyVYrCqwNhmq6Gdn6fGcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./craig-jackson-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Craig Jackson Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-skies-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Skies Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-heirs-to-enormous-american-fortunes.html>15 Heirs To Enormous American Fortunes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./seabiscuit.html>Seabiscuit (Movie) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./badou-jack.html>Badou Jack Height, Age, Wife, Biography, Family, Net worth &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kris-jenner-blackmailed-naked-footage-kuwtk-sneak-peek-2015234.html>Kris Jenner Gets Blackmailed With Naked Footage in KUWTK Sneak Peek</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabriel-rosado-net-worth.html>Gabriel Rosado Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVlog.
