As a child actor, Gabriel has appeared in a number of well-known horror franchise movies, including Annabelle (2014), Lights Out (2016), and Child’s Play (2019). Gabriel has a preference for the horrifying and monstrous based on his performances.</p><h2><strong>A Cursory Look at Gabriel Bateman’s Siblings</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Justin Bateman</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> July 27, 1988</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>35 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Actor</li></ul><p>Among the Gabriel Bateman siblings, Justin is the oldest and the first child of Tim Bateman and Jonelle Batman. He was born in Alameda County, California, in the United States of America. Justin picked up a career in acting, though he hasn’t appeared in a lot of movies.</p><p>One of the movies he is known for is I (Almost) Got Away With It, a movie series characterized by all kinds of criminal elements in the real world, which aired from 2010 to 2016. Gabriel Bateman’s oldest sibling took the role of James Wiley in one of the episodes of the movie series. Irrespective of the 16-year age gap between Gabriel and Justin, they are seen to get along pretty well.</p><p>Despite being the oldest among his siblings, Justin’s acting career can not be compared with that of his brother Gabriel. This may be attributed to skills or acting roles that may have not favored him to rise to the level of fame his younger brother has attained in the industry.</p><h3><strong>2. Hannah Bateman</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> March 12, 1993</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>30 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Actress</li></ul><p>The actress is the oldest of the female siblings of Gabriel Bateman. She was born in California, the United States of America. Though she has a profile as an actress, she can be regarded as one with a very low profile in the movie industry. Hannah once starred in the 2012 George Biddle, CPA, taking up the role of the Machinist’s daughter.</p><p>After appearing in the 2012 movie series, the actress had a long break from playing any role until 2021, when she starred on the J Team as a P Pac Dancer. The long break was a result of her decision to gain an EMT license. She is seen to be 11 years older than her brother Gabriel, who has climbed good heights in his acting career. The two are also seen to have a good relationship as siblings despite the age gap and career achievements.</p><h3><strong>3. Leah Bateman</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> May 9, 1995</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>28 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Actress, Composer, and Writer</li></ul><p>Leah Bateman is the second sister and third sibling to Gabriel Bateman, who is seen to have a diversified portfolio when compared with the other siblings. Leah is not just an actress but also a composer and a writer. She started her acting career at the age of twelve in a musical theater, where she tried out for her Broadway debut as Jane Banks in Mary Poppins.</p><p>Leah was active in all aspects of theatre before turning sixteen and also composed songs, plays, and poetry.&nbsp;Her love for performing became so intense at that point that her parents assisted in helping her get an agent and she relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film acting. The actress is 9 years older than her brother, Gabriel Bateman. Though she has acquired some recognition in her acting career, it can not be compared with that of her younger brother.</p><h3><strong>4. Judah Bateman&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> March 9, 1999</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>24 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Actor</li></ul><p>Judah is the fourth child and second brother of Gabriel Bateman, who has also secured a place in the movie industry. He is the second son and the fourth child of Tim and Jonelle Bateman. The actor is 5 years older than his sibling, Gabriel Bateman, and is still ranked under his younger sibling when it comes to their acting careers.

However, he has featured in some other movies like the Pals (2016), and The Divergence (2017).

Although there is little information about Noah’s personal life and career, it is known that he has taken roles in some short movies and also features with the Bateman crew. Noah had the lead role in the 2020 short movie titled Walk.</p><p>Despite giving his brother Gabriel an age gap of four years, he is seen to be behind his brother in the movie industry. Meanwhile, it is believed that as they progress in the industry, he will develop a better acting profile.</p><h3><strong>6. Talitha Bateman</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 4, 2001</li><li><strong>Age: </strong>22 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Actress</li></ul><p>Talitha is one of the siblings of Gabriel Bateman, who has proved her prowess in her acting career.

With his brother and other siblings making names in the industry, he will soon find his grounds in acting.</p><h2><strong>Is Gabriel Bateman Related to Jason Bateman?</strong></h2><p>Gabriel Bateman and Jason Batman are not related.
