(1997–2003) and Albert "Pops" Solomon on ABC's "The Goldbergs" (2013–2021), and he earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Nick in the film "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (1966).</p><p>George had more than 120 acting credits to his name, including the films "Ship of Fools" (1965), "The Owl and the Pussycat" (1970), "Fun with Dick and Jane" (1977), "Look Who's Talking" (1989), "The Cable Guy" (1996), and "Love & Other Drugs" (2012) and the television series "Murphy's Law" (1988–1989) and "Retired at 35" (2011–2012). He also produced the film "The Black Bird" (1975) and released the albums "The Yama Yama Man" (1967), "A Touch of Ragtime" (1974), and "Basin Street" (1987).

Sadly, George died in March 2021 at the age of 87.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>George Segal was born George Segal Jr. on February 13, 1934, in Great Neck, New York. Though he came from a Jewish family, Segal's parents, Frannie and George Sr. (a malt and hop agent), raised him in a secular household. George grew up with two older brothers, John and Fred, and his sister, Greta, passed away from pneumonia before Segal was born. At age 9, George saw the 1942 film "This Gun for Hire" and became interested in becoming an actor. He also learned to play the ukulele and banjo during his youth, and he told the "Chicago Tribune," "I started off with the ukulele when I was a kid in Great Neck. A friend had a red Harold Teen model; it won my heart. When I got to high school, I realized you couldn't play in a band with a ukulele, so I moved on to the four-string banjo." After George Sr. died in 1947, Frannie and George moved to New York City. Segal attended the Pennsylvania boarding school George School, graduating in 1951, then he enrolled at Haverford College. He later transferred to Columbia University's Columbia College, earning a Bachelor of Arts in drama and performing arts in 1955. George played banjo at both of the colleges he attended, and at Columbia, he performed with a dixieland jazz band that went by numerous different names, including Bruno Lynch and his Imperial Jazz Band and the Red Onion Jazz Band.
