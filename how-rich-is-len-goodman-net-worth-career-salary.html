After announcing his departure, Len congratulated the DWTS family for a “great experience” and expressed excitement for the show’s finale, which he predicts will be “amazing.”</p><h2>Due to age-related problems, DWTS judge Len Goodman is resigning from the program.</h2><p>The decision to resign comes as it has become “more difficult” to perform the performance of Len Goodman owing to his age. He stated to People:</p><p>“I haven’t fallen asleep or begun dribbling on the program yet, so I figured it’s better to go before I do!”</p><p>He continues, saying:</p><p>“I will miss the California sunlight, working with my colleague’s judges, and the camaraderie on the program.” I’ll miss witnessing celebrities blossom into dancers and being a part of one of television’s most popular series.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Len-Goodman.jpg alt="Len Goodman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The judge got a standing ovation after announcing his retirement.
