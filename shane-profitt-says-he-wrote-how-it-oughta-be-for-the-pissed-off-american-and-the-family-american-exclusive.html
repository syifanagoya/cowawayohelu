href=#><strong>Shane Profitt</strong></a> is just scratching the surface of the country music industry &nbsp;with big plans for the remainder of 2023.</p><p>From working a full time job to selling out shows in just one year, the rising country artist has had a musical journey that is anything BUT conventional, and he chatted with <strong>Celeb Secrets</strong> host <a href=#><strong>Juliet Schroder</strong></a> all about it at this year’s <a href=#><strong>Country Radio Seminar</strong></a> in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>“13 months ago I was making $11 an hour cutting grass in the medians of the road, and now getting to, you know, be a part of <a href=#><strong>CRS</strong></a>,” Profitt gushed.</p><p>“Last year, <a href=#><strong>Chris Janson</strong></a> offered me a publishing deal, and I got to quit my job and start writing music full-time, and I was kind of helping him around the house and the farm last year,” he continued with a smirk. “I ended up driving him to CRS and just waiting in the car, so this is my first time getting to be on the inside of it.”</p><p>While this may have been Shane Profitt’s first year at Country Radio Seminar, this will <span>definitely</span> not be his last.</p><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@theshaneprofitt/video/7135882219930799402?_r=1&_t=8cnBvYxaVRO</p><p>While the budding country star has been putting out phenomenal music right and left, one of his most notable releases is “<a href=#>How It Oughta Be</a>,” a heartfelt track that hit all music streaming platforms at the tail end of 2022.</p><p>“‘How It Oughta Be,’ you know, it’s a song that I wrote just kind of for the pissed off American, but at the same time, like the family American… That’s just kind of where I come from,” Profitt dished.</p><p>“I feel like if everybody in today’s world had more of that family life and, you know, just maybe prayed a little more and, you know, just were better human beings in general, this world wouldn’t be so crazy, and that’s ‘How It Oughta Be,'” he continued passionately.</p><p>Since its release, the 23-year-old revealed to Celeb Secrets that “the feedback has been phenomenal.”</p><p>“In the opening line, it says ‘teachers oughta get doctor’s and lawyer’s pay.’ I’ve had countless messages from all the teachers all around the U.S., even some in Canada and, you know, overseas, and it’s just, you know, every week that I have a show, getting to hear the crowd sing that back to me. It’s a feeling like you can’t even explain it,” he shared with a smile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SP_SINGLE_StillPicksUp_Cover_2023.05.23_FNL-scaled.jpg><p>While “How It Oughta Be” serves as the emerging artist’s most popular release, his most recent release is a track called “<a href=#>Still Picks Up</a>,” which hit all music streaming platforms this past Friday (June 30th).</p><p>“The sentimental ‘Still Picks Up’ strikes a chord, instantly reminding every listener of the love and appreciation felt for that one person that will always pick up the phone, no questions asked,” ultimately showing a much more emotional side to the&nbsp;country crooner.</p><p>A recent press release from his management company, <strong>Big Machine Label Group</strong>, shared the story behind the ultra vulnerable track: “Penned from a painful memory forever burned into his mind, ‘Still Picks Up’ came to Profitt as he sat in the hospital waiting room, minutes after his father had suffered from a stroke on their annual hunting trip.”</p><p>“Like many others, the artist’s father had always been that one person he could go to for anything, and facing the harsh possibility of losing him, it immediately put things into perspective. Profitt knows those feelings of panic, sadness and regret in the waiting room are something that all folks, country or not, can relate to on some level,” the press release continued, ultimately tugging on our heartstrings.</p><p>In the wise words of Profitt himself, “When you’re about to lose someone that means so much, you start to reflect on the stupid fights that could have been avoided and all the things you should have said. By the grace of God, my father is okay and here with me today, so I wrote ‘Still Picks Up’ to remind us to call those important folks in our lives while they can still pick up the phone, because tomorrow is not promised.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Shane-Profitt_Press-Image-1_Credit-Dustin-Haney-scaled.jpg><p>Lucky for fans everywhere, “How It Oughta Be” and “Still Picks Up” are just small glimpses into everything the talented singer-songwriter has in store, with a full-length project currently in the works.</p><p>“I feel like on this project, the songs are really good, but I would just be ignorant to say that they’re as best as they can be because they’re not,” Profitt revealed to Celeb Secrets. “With that being said, I think they are really good, and I think, you know, there’s always room to grow as a songwriter and an artist, so I just wanna try to grow.”</p><p>“I want to get to see more of the world and country and, you know, just be the best artist that I can be,” Shane spilled, and we know that he will get there in no time!</p><p>While the “carefree singer-songwriter and rising star continues his rollout of new music, revealing more personal layers and emotion to his usual feel-good, windows-down sound,” be sure to check out our full interview with him from Country Radio Seminar below.</p><p>Do you like what you see?</p><p>If so, be sure to leave a reaction at the bottom of the post and/or send us a tweet at <a href=#>@celebsecrets</a> to let us know how excited you are for Shane Profitt’s new music, then follow him on Instagram <a href=#>@<span class=gmail-il>theshaneprofitt</span></a><span class=gmail-Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>and TikTok <a href=#>@theshaneprofitt</a> for updates on <span>everything</span> that he has on the way — You won’t want to miss a thing!</p><p><strong>LISTEN TO “HOW IT OUGHTA BE” HERE:</strong></p><p><strong>LISTEN TO “STILL PICKS UP” HERE:</strong></p><p><i>With reporting credit by Juliet Schroder.
