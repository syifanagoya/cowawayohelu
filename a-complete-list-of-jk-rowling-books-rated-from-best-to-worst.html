Dubbed as one of the bestselling British authors of all time, Rowling first worked as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International before her writing career began. However, she conceived the Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. Today, the series has been one of the highest-grossing books in history.</p><p>Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling’s rags to riches story has also inspired many upcoming authors in recent times. And since the inception of her career, J K Rowling has won multiple awards and has sold over 500 million copies of her books, thus cementing her status as the first world’s billionaire author. Below is a list of J K Rowling’s books as rated from best to worst, including her other publications.</p><h2><strong>List of J.K Rowling Books Rated From Best To Worst</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban (1999)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.57/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 4.8/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.6/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Harry-Potter.png><p>Although it is the third book in the Harry Potter series, Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the best books by J K Rowling. It follows the young wizard Harry Potter in his third year at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with his friends, Potter investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, who they believe is one of Lord Voldemort’s old allies.</p><p>Released in 1999, the novel is regarded as the best of the Harry Potter series, and the storyline will always make you pick it up again and again. Soon after it was released, Prisoner of Azkaban won several awards, including the 1999 Whitebread Children’s Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the Best Fantasy Award in the Year 2000. It was adapted into a feature film of the same name that was released in 2004. Like the novel, a New York Times bestseller, the film adaptation was also a box office hit.</p><h3><strong>2. Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince (2005)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.57/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 4.8/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.6/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince.png><p>Despite being the sixth installment in the Harry Potter franchise, The Half-Blood Prince is one of the best J K Rowling books in the Potter series. Its incredible storyline endures, persists, and fights its way into the heart of readers back to back. Filled with suspense, this novel took a darker tone than previous books in the Potter series, albeit it comes with a little bit of humor while delving into different aspects such as trust, death, love, and redemption.</p><p>It follows the young wizard, Potter, in his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The storyline explores the past of Lord Voldemort’s nemesis and Potter’s preparation for the final battle against him, along with his headmaster Albus.</p><p>Soon after it was released, the book sold nine million copies within 24 hours and topped the bestsellers’ lists in the UK and the US. It took home the 2006 British Book of the Year Award and other awards, including Quill Awards for Best Children’s Book and Best Book of the Year and Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Seal, etc.</p><h3><strong>3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.57/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 4.8/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.6/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows.png><p>Another interesting one from the author and the seventh in the Harry Potter series, The Deathly Hallows, beautifully wrapped up the series in a satisfying and largely unpredictable way. Released in 2007, the storyline continued from where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (released in 2005) stopped. It revolves around the final confrontation between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.</p><p>Soon after it was released, the novel made history with a sales record of 8.3 million in the US alone and 2.65 million in the United Kingdom within 24 hours. In addition to getting positive reviews from critics, The Deathly Hallows won many awards, including the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Award and Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association. To do the story justice, its film adaption was released in two parts – Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow – Part 1 (2010) and Part 2 (2011). The novel also inspired two action-adventure video games, and it has an audiobook, released in 2007.</p><h3><strong>4. Harry Potter and The Philosopher’s Stone (1997)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.5/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 5/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.5/5</li></ul><p>The first book in the Harry Potter series, The Philosopher’s Stone, started it all and remained one of J K Rowling’s best books out there. It chronicles the life of a young wizard, Harry Potter, who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Although he makes close friends and few enemies, Potter faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, who killed his parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.</p><p>It was first published in the UK in 1997, and the following year, it was published in American under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. The book garnered positive reviews and also raked in several awards, including UK’s National Book Award and Smarties Award, among many others. It translated into a feature film of the same name, released in 1999, and a host of video games.</p><h3><strong>5. Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix (2003)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.5/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 5/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.5/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix.png><p>The Order of Phoenix is yet another thriller from the British author and the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. Released in 2003, the novel follows Harry Potter’s struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts, including the surreptitious return of Lord Voldemort, Ministry of Magic, and O.W.L exams. Soon after it was published, the book sold over five million copies within 24 hours and garnered several awards. Despite being the longest book in the series, The Order of Phoenix remains one of the best books by J K Rowling. It was adapted into a film which was released in 2007.</p><h3><strong>6. Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire (2000)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.6/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 5/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.6/5</li></ul><p>A sequel to Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire’s plot centers on Harry Potter’s fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as well as the mystery surrounding the entry of Potter’s name into the Triwizard Tournament, in which he is forced to compete. Released in the year 2000, the novel became one of the highest-grossing books and topped the bestsellers’ lists.</p><p>It fetched several awards, including the 2001 Hugo Award for Best Novel, Indian Paintbrush Book Award, and Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award. Although the book has an interesting storyline, the tournament structure makes things a little more regimented, predictable, and even boring at some point.</p><h3><strong>7. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4.4/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 4.2/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.9/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4.4/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chamber-of-Secrets.png><p>While J K Rowling’s Harry Potter series are somewhat truly fantastic magical installments, The Chamber of Secrets, which happens to be one of the books in the series, is, unfortunately, the least fantastic. The Philosopher’s Stone did a solid job at effortlessly setting up Potter’s world, while this second installment does a little to help further the readers understand the world and the characters in it.</p><p>The plot chronicles Potter’s second year at the school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a series of messages appear on the walls of the school’s corridors, warning that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened and that the heir of Slytherin would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families, Harry, and his friends take it upon themselves to investigate the series of attacks that has made all the residents petrified.</p><p>Even though the novel was commercially successful and highly acclaimed, the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. The novel also triggered serious religious debates; while some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, others praised it for its emphasis on self-sacrifice and how our character influences our choices in life. It was also adapted into a film of the same name that was released in 2002. Like the novel, the film was also commercially successful and was rated the fifth highest-grossing film. It also inspired several video games of the same name.</p><h3><strong>8. The Casual Vacancy (2012)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 3.3/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 3.6/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 3.3/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Casual-Vacancy.png><p>Set in a suburban West Country town named Pagford, The Casual Vacancy is another book from the British writer, published in 2012. The novel depicts how politics, social issues, class, prostitution, and rape can affect society differently. The plot follows the aftermath of the death of a local Pagford Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother, who suffers a burst aneurysm in the car park of a local golf course. In a bid to elect his successor, conflict ensues. However, the people running for the position soon find their darkest secret revealed on the Parish Council online forum, running their election and leaving the election in turmoil.</p><p>Released in the year 2012, The Casual Vacancy sold over a million copies, hence becoming the fastest-selling novel in the UK for three years. Interestingly, it also holds the Goodreads record of the all-time biggest reading day and garnered Best Fiction Award at the Goodreads Choice Award in 2012. More so, it was adapted into a TV drama that aired on BBC One in 2015.</p><h3><strong>9. The Cuckoo’s Calling (Cormoran Strike Series) (2013)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 3.9/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.4/5</li><li><strong>Audiobooks:</strong> 4.3/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 3.9/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Cuckoos-Calling.png><p>The Cuckoo’s Calling happens to be among J K Rowing books that make up the Cormoran Strike series. Released in 2013, the book is a crime fiction that chronicles the life of a Disabled Afghan War veteran and struggling private investigator, Cormoran Strike. After Strike’s childhood soulmate Charlie’s death, her adoptive brother John Bristow wants Strike to investigate her death further. Because of his need for money, Strike takes on the case.</p><p>Before publication, J K Rowling changed her pen name to Robert Galbraith, which made readers not recognize who the author was. As a result, the book was not commercially successful like the Potter series, as only 1,500 copies have been sold since it was released in 2013. However, when it became public knowledge that she was the writer, the book garnered critical acclaim. It has been adapted into a TV series, Strike, which premiered on BBC One in 2017.</p><h3><strong>10. The Tales of Beedle the Bard (2008)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Goodreads:</strong> 4/5</li><li><strong>Common Sense Media:</strong> 4/5</li><li><strong>Audible:</strong> 4.6/5</li><li><strong>Abebooks:</strong> 4/5</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/byliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Tales-of-Beedle-The-Bard.png><p>One of the most interesting books coming from J K Rowling, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, was first seen in the Harry Potter series’s final novel (The Deathly Hallows), where it was used as a fictional book. It was given to Hermione Granger by Albus Dumbledore, former headmaster of Hogwarts. Best described as a famous collection of children’s fairy tales, the book introduced the Deathly Hallows to the trio – Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger.</p><p>Released a year after The Deathly Hallows, this 115-paged handmade edition was bought for $3 million by Amazon, making it the highest achieved auction for a modern literary manuscript. It was later made available for the public, and so far, only a hundred thousand copies of the book have been printed. More so, Rowling sent the proceeds from the sale of the books to the Children High-Level Group.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Grantland Rice List of Books, Essays, Articles & Literary Works</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Recap</strong></h2><p><strong>Here’s a quick look at J K Rowling books rated from best to worst</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban (1999)</p><p>2.&nbsp;Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince (2005)</p><p>3.&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007)</p><p>4.
