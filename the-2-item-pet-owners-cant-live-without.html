She was using rubber gloves every day to scrape the unsightly fur away — until she saw the rubber squeegee at her local Kmart store and had a light bulb moment.</p><p>“I honestly had little hope when I picked it up off the shelf, but I thought that it was only $2 and I could use it elsewhere if it didn’t work, so I had nothing to lose,” she said.</p><p>“I am definitely loving the results and it’s so easy!</p><p>“I have another window washer from Kmart that I actually use for windows — this one is purely for the couch.”</p><p>Just run the squeegee along the couch — or even carpet — and watch the hair come right out. Some recommend wetting the squeegee before using it for best results.</p><p>Sharing her life-changing find on social media, Ms Penton received thousands of shares, likes and comments from fellow frustrated animal lovers from across the country.</p><p>“I was very surprised by the feedback I received, especially since I thought about not posting it because I thought it was just lame — I’m hoping the hack will benefit other pet owners,” she said.</p><p>“I have three cats — a tortoiseshell called Milo, ginger called Ronnie and a black and white cat called Max.</p><p>“I was originally using rubber gloves, but was having a slight reaction, because I was having to use them every day.</p><p>“I purchased the squeegee just for the couch, because I saw it and thought it may work because of the rubber bottom.”</p><p>Some pet owners use masking tape or a lint remover to get rid of the hair. Others sweep with a wet broom before vacuuming — but Ms Penton said the easy to use, cheap window cleaner works a treat.</p><p>“I feel it’s quicker with the squeegee and also better for my back, as I don’t have to bend as much,” Ms Penton told news.com.au</p><p>“With the rubber gloves it was hard to do the softer parts like the headrest and arms and also getting into the grooves and tight stops — the squeegee does all that with ease.”</p><p>She said she uses the squeegee and pushes all the hair on to the floor to then vacuum it up.</p><p>“The squeegee creates a thin line of hair, whereas using a rubber glove made a wider pile,” Ms Penton said.</p><p>“The hair would constantly stick to the glove, but doesn’t stick to the squeegee — it’s perfect.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bhtqex0q2wpZ1fnbyusY6pnK2rX6m1pnmRZqCtnZ1ivabAjKiup52iqHqkrc2tZKWhppp6uLXToaaurF%2Bjsri%2FjKyrqKqpZH16sY9ybpttkWuzooXCcJlraWVlfXKyk2xwnJyVl4Ki</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./trevor-wright.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Trevor Wright</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./74959-why-do-cats-knock-things-over-heres-the-scientific-reason-your-kitty-acts-like-a-jerk.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Do Cats Knock Things Over?
